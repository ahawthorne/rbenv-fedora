rbenv-fedora
============

Fedora + rbenv because of reasons. To achieve this, you must meet dependencies. But you don't have time for shenanigans like dependencies.

So do this instead:

Clone it
--------
typical plugin path is ~/.rbenv/plugins. 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ahawthorne/rbenv-fedora.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/rbenv-fedora
```
Do it.
------

```
rbenv fedora
```
and make sweet rubies.
